I'm honored to be invited to deliver a talk for the "Narratives and AI in Quantitative History: A Mandarin Workshop" organized by Professor Chicheng Ma at <font color=Green>The University of Hong Kong</font>.<br><br>

**Title:** <u>AI for the Humanities</u>.<br><br>

**Abstract:** The development of artificial intelligence is transforming the way humanities scholars conduct research. Adopting an interdisciplinary perspective, this presentation will illustrate how AI can be effectively integrated into the humanities and social sciences, including psychology, geography, and history, through three specific case studies: (1) surveying the dead minds; (2) geocoding the past world; and (3) renacting intellectual debates in history.
