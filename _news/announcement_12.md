I'm honored to be invited to deliver a talk for the "Frontiers in Chinese Studies" series organized by Professor Song Chen at <font color=Green>Bucknell University</font>.<br><br>

**Title:** <u>Historical Minds and Artificial Intelligence: How AI Helps Rediscover Ancient Minds</u>.<br><br>

**Abstract:** Advances in AI, particularly in natural language processing, have enabled large-scale quantitative analysis of historical texts. This talk presents two cases using AI models to explore intellectual debates and cultural psychology in premodern China.
