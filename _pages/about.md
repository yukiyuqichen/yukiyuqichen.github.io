Hi, I'm Yuqi Chen.

I'm a PhD candidate at Peking University.

My research interests primarily lie in: 

(1) using quantitative methods such as spatial analysis, time series analysis, and social network analysis to advance archaeological and historical research; 

(2) using AI methods to understand human sentiment and the evolution of cultural psychology.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.
